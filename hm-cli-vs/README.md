# hm-cli
Based on the Awesome-cli available here:

https://github.com/tucaz/awesome-cli

At a minimum, a HM product requires the following:

connectTypes.cm
constants.cm
extension.cm
extension.xml
header.cm
init.cm
library.cm
package.cm

TAGS
TAGSRS

There is also an abbreviated-productname file with the .rs extension:

shortextensionname.rs

This is followed by a selection of files with a lowercase two initial prefix such as "ae" (in the case of Abak Environments):


##ConnectRules.cm
##Scheme.cm
##WorkSurface.cm







and a \EMEA sub-folder with some of the above repeated:

emea\header.cm
emea\init.cm
emea\package.cm
